At that same debugger break-point, the dom is visibly missing an empty space for the list div. I checked to see the setFixtures() parameters in the test, and they were indeed missing the ul.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nAdd `<ul id=\"list\"></ul>` to the `#games` div, or just replace line 305 with:\r\n```\r\n    setFixtures('<body><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"40\"><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"0\">X</td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"0\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"0\"></td></tr><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"1\">O</td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"1\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"1\"></td></tr><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"2\"></td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"2\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"2\"></td></tr></table><div id=\"games\"><ul id=\"list\"></ul></div><div id=\"message\"></div><button id=\"save\">Save Game</button><button id=\"previous\">Show Previous Games</button></body>');\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now that the div has a permanent child, we just created a new problem with line 307:\r\n```\r\n#integration tests of persistence if i click the previous game button and a game has already been saved it should add the previous game to the DOM\r\nExpected 1 to be 0.\r\nError: Expected 1 to be 0.\r\n    at stack (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1293:17)\r\n    at buildExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1270:14)\r\n    at Spec.Env.expectationResultFactory (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:484:18)\r\n    at Spec.addExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:260:46)\r\n    at Expectation.addExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:442:21)\r\n    at Expectation.toBe (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1209:12)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (file:///Users/Roberto/Development/code/js-tictactoe-rails-api-v-000/spec/tictactoe.spec.js:307:43)\r\n    at attemptSync (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1510:12)\r\n    at QueueRunner.run (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1498:9)\r\n    at QueueRunner.execute (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1485:10)\r\n```\r\nFix:\r\nChange line 307: `expect($(\"#games\").children().length).toBe(0);` to `expect($(\"#list\").children().length).toBe(0);`\r\n\r\nChange line 322: `expect($(\"#games\").children().length).toBe(1);` to `expect($(\"#list\").children().length).toBe(1);`\r\n\r\nThat is, assuming the ul originally has an id = list.
